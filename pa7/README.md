##Description of Program: This program is an implementation of the Dictionary ADT and is written in C++. The main program is called Order.cpp and the implementation is in Dictionary.cpp. The Dictionary ADT consists of nodes that are formatted and organized as a BST or Binary Search Tree. Additionally each element in this tree is a node with a key and a value. The key is a string and the value is an int.
###Build for Program: Dictionary.h: the header file for Dictionary.cpp that layouts the interface, Dictionary.cpp: contains the implementation for the Dictionary ADT, DictionaryTest.cpp: a program to help test the Dictionary, Order.cpp: the main for this program, the input is <infile><outfile>, Makefile: This file compiles the program by typing in make in the command line. README.md: describes the program and build for the program.
####User Guide: The first step to use this program is to use the command make. Then the user can type in ./Order <infile> <outfile> so they can view how the Dictionary in outfile. There's alpha order listed first in the outfile followed by the preorder of the keys after.
